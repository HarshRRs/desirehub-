# 🚀 DesireHub Launch Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Finalize the DesireHub platform for a "Go Live" state, ensuring it meets adult industry standards and has full functionality.

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### 1. 🔞 Adult Industry Compliance (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Implement Age Verification Modal:** A mandatory overlay that requires users to confirm they are 18+ before entering the site.
- [ ] **Update Footer:** Ensure "18+" warning and "RTA" (Restricted to Adults) label are visible.

### 2. 🔌 Backend Connection (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Connect Supabase:** The project needs a live backend for users, videos, and authentication to work.
- [ ] **Run Migrations:** Create the database tables.

### 3. 🎨 Design & Content Polish
- [ ] **Hero Image:** Add a premium background image to the homepage.
- [ ] **Sample Content:** Populate the database with a few "demo" videos and creators so the site isn't empty.

### 4. 💳 Monetization (Optional for Day 1, but critical)
- [ ] **Payment Gateway:** Verify the Stripe/Payment integration is ready to accept test payments.

## 🛠 Implementation Steps for Today

1.  **Create Age Verification Modal:** I will build a `AgeVerificationModal.tsx` component and add it to the global layout.
2.  **Update Footer:** Add standard compliance text.
3.  **Guide User on Supabase:** Provide the exact SQL to run.
